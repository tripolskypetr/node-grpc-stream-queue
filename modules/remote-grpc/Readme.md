## ProtoService

ProtoService is a TypeScript class that provides functionality for managing gRPC services. It has a constructor, properties such as loggerService and _protoMap, and methods like loadProto, makeClient, and makeServer. The loggerService property is used for logging, while _protoMap stores the loaded gRPC protobuf definitions. The loadProto method loads a gRPC protobuf definition by name and returns the corresponding GrpcObject. The makeClient method creates a client for the specified gRPC service, while makeServer creates a server for the specified gRPC service using a provided connector. The available services are "FooService", "BarService", and "BazService".

## LoggerService

The LoggerService is a TypeScript class that provides logging functionality. It has a constructor which initializes the `_logger` property, likely an instance of a logging library or object. The `log` property is a function that allows you to log messages with optional arguments. The `setPrefix` property is a function that allows you to set a prefix for all log messages.

## FooClientService

The `FooClientService` is a TypeScript class that implements the `GRPC.IFooService` interface, which means it provides methods to interact with a gRPC service. The class has three properties: `protoService`, `loggerService`, and `_fooClient`. 

The constructor of `FooClientService` does not take any arguments.

The `protoService` property is of type `any`, and it seems to be a reference to the protobuf service definition.

The `loggerService` property is of type `any`, and it appears to be a logger service for logging messages.

The `_fooClient` property is of type `any`, and it seems to be a client for communicating with the gRPC service.

The `Execute` method is a generic function that takes any number of arguments and returns a Promise. It is used to execute the gRPC service methods.

The `init` method is a void function that initializes the `_fooClient` property by creating a new instance of the gRPC client using the `protoService` and `loggerService`.

## BazClientService

The BazClientService is a TypeScript class that implements the `GRPC.IBazService` interface, which means it provides methods to interact with a gRPC service. The class has three properties: `protoService`, `loggerService`, and `_bazClient`. 

The constructor of the class is used to initialize it, but its implementation details are not specified in the reference. 

The `protoService` property is of type any and seems to hold the protobuf service definition. The `loggerService` property is also of type any and appears to be a logger service for logging messages. The `_bazClient` property is of type any and seems to be a client for interacting with the gRPC service.

The `Execute` method is a generic function that takes any number of arguments and returns a Promise. It is used to execute the gRPC service method.

The `init` method is used to initialize the class, but its implementation details are not specified in the reference.

## BarClientService

The `BarClientService` is a class that implements the `GRPC.IBarService` interface, which means it provides methods to interact with a gRPC service related to bars. The class has a constructor that initializes the `protoService` and `loggerService` properties, as well as the private `_barClient` property.

The `protoService` property holds the gRPC service definition, which is used to generate the client stub for interacting with the gRPC service. The `loggerService` property is an instance of a logger service, which can be used to log messages during the execution of the class methods.

The `_barClient` property is a private instance of the gRPC client, which is created using the `protoService` property.

The class also has two methods: `Execute` and `init`. The `Execute` method is a generic function that takes any number of arguments and returns a Promise. It is used to execute gRPC calls by passing the arguments and returning the response. The `init` method is used to initialize the gRPC client by creating an instance of it using the `protoService` property.

Overall, the `BarClientService` class provides a way to interact with a gRPC service related to bars by initializing the client and executing gRPC calls.
